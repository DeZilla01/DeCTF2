# DeCTF2
Rewrite of DeCTF based on the now defunct McCTF plugin from McPvP/Brawl

This project is being created 1 month after the full shutdown of McBrawl, thus rendering McCTF defunct. At the current moment, this is somewhat of a side project with no ETA to bring some life back to McPvP's legacy. Project is currently private to lower expectations. Reason of writing this based on DeCTF rather than McCTF code is to somewhat keep ownership and being able to freely release the plugin when ready.
